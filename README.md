# BIOS-GRAPHICS
A simple 'Operating System' that just lets you move a cube on a screen.

An expansion of my previous [BIOS-PRINT](https://github.com/jayc3-3/BIOS-PRINT) "os test".
Features 320x200 8-bit double-buffered graphics, and everything else [BIOS-PRINT](https://github.com/jayc3-3/BIOS-PRINT) does.
